# Enion
Enion - encryption &amp; decryption program written by two students University of Tartu 
## Using
You have to import gradle with JavaFX extention
Programm was tested in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
## What you can do with program? 
It only works with 16-bit keys
Basically you can encrypt every file what you can imagine and after decrypt it as well.
We use SHA256 incryption, seed is generated by CPU, which means that seed could be compromised, but don't think about it too much.
Better solutions are based on hardware security module that have True Random Number Generator for encryption seed.
### Everything about classes
* 'MainTest' is Main class where all GUI is based
* 'Crypto' is class about encryption/decryption
* 'PasswordError' is class, where password status is located
* 'Scene1' is class with animation, that looks cool, but we can't implement it in MainTest class
